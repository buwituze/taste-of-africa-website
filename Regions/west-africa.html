                <h2>The Heart of Bold Flavors</h2>
                <p>West African cuisine is renowned for its bold, vibrant flavors and the generous use of aromatic spices and peppers. This region's food culture reflects centuries of tradition, community, and celebration, with dishes that bring people together around shared meals.</p>
                
                <p>The cuisine is characterized by hearty one-pot dishes, rich stews, and the prominent use of ingredients like <mark>tomatoes</mark>, <mark>onions</mark>, <mark>scotch bonnet peppers</mark>, and <mark>palm oil</mark>. Rice, cassava, yams, and plantains form the starchy foundation of many meals, while peanuts (groundnuts) add richness and depth to sauces.</p>
                
                <h3>Staple Ingredients</h3>
                <p>West African cooking relies heavily on locally sourced ingredients that have sustained communities for generations. <mark>Egusi seeds</mark> (melon seeds) are ground into powder for thick, nutty soups. <mark>Okra</mark> adds texture and body to stews, while <mark>dried fish</mark> and <mark>stockfish</mark> provide umami depth to vegetable dishes.</p>
                
                <h3>Cooking Techniques</h3>
                <p>Traditional cooking methods include slow-simmering stews in clay pots, <mark>smoking</mark> meats and fish over wood fires for intense flavor, and <mark>pounding</mark> starchy vegetables to create the beloved fufu. The art of <mark>jollofing</mark>—cooking rice in a rich tomato sauce—has become legendary, sparking friendly regional debates about whose version is best.</p>
                
                <p>Grilling techniques, particularly for <mark>suya</mark> (spiced meat skewers), showcase the region's mastery of spice blends combining ginger, garlic, paprika, and ground peanuts.</p>
