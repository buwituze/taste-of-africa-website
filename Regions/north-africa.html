                <h2>Where Mediterranean Meets African Heritage</h2>
                <p>North African cuisine represents a sophisticated fusion of Berber, Arab, Mediterranean, and French influences, creating a distinctive culinary identity that celebrates both savory and sweet flavors in harmony. The region's food culture has been shaped by ancient trade routes, bringing exotic spices and cooking techniques from across continents.</p>
                
                <p>This cuisine is characterized by the artful use of aromatic spices like <mark>cumin</mark>, <mark>coriander</mark>, <mark>cinnamon</mark>, and the prized <mark>saffron</mark>. Preserved lemons, olives, and olive oil feature prominently, reflecting the Mediterranean connection, while dates, almonds, and honey add layers of sweetness to both savory and sweet dishes.</p>
                
                <h3>Staple Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Couscous serves as the primary starch, often steamed to fluffy perfection and served as a base for stews. <mark>Harissa</mark>, a fiery chili paste, adds heat and complexity to countless dishes. <mark>Ras el hanout</mark>, a complex spice blend containing up to 30 ingredients, epitomizes the region's sophisticated approach to seasoning.</p>
                
                <h3>Cooking Techniques</h3>
                <p>The tagine cooking method—slow-simmering ingredients in a conical earthenware pot—creates tender, aromatic dishes where flavors meld beautifully. <mark>Charmoula</mark>, a marinade technique using herbs and spices, transforms fish and meat. <mark>Slow roasting</mark> in clay ovens produces tender, fall-off-the-bone meats for special occasions.</p>
                
                <p>Bread-making is an art form, with each country having signature flatbreads. The technique of <mark>steaming couscous</mark> over simmering stew in a couscoussier ensures the grains absorb maximum flavor while maintaining their light, fluffy texture.</p>
