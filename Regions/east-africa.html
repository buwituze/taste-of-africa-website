                <h2>A Blend of Ancient Traditions and Coastal Influences</h2>
                <p>East African cuisine is a fascinating tapestry woven from indigenous traditions, Arab trading influences, Indian spices, and coastal Swahili culture. The region's strategic location along ancient trade routes has created a unique culinary identity that balances subtle spicing with bold flavors.</p>
                
                <p>The cuisine features distinctive elements like <mark>berbere</mark> (Ethiopian spice blend), <mark>cardamom</mark>, <mark>cloves</mark>, and <mark>coconut</mark>. Injera serves as both plate and utensil in Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine, while ugali (a cornmeal porridge) is the staple across much of the region. <mark>Pilau rice</mark>, fragrant with spices, reflects centuries of Indian Ocean trade.</p>
                
                <h3>Staple Ingredients</h3>
                <p>The region's diverse geography yields unique ingredients. <mark>Teff</mark>, a tiny ancient grain native to Ethiopia, forms the basis of injera. <mark>Cassava</mark>, <mark>sweet potatoes</mark>, and various beans provide sustenance, while <mark>coconut milk</mark> enriches coastal dishes. <mark>Nyama choma</mark> (roasted meat) is beloved across the region.</p>
                
                <h3>Cooking Techniques</h3>
                <p>Ethiopian cuisine showcases <mark>wet cooking</mark> methods, creating richly spiced stews called wats served communally on injera. <mark>Dry roasting</mark> spices before grinding intensifies flavors in berbere and other spice blends. Along the coast, <mark>coconut-based curries</mark> reflect Swahili culinary arts.</p>
                
                <p>The art of <mark>fermenting</mark> teff for injera creates its signature sour taste. <mark>Open-fire grilling</mark> for nyama choma produces smoky, charred meats that are social centerpieces. <mark>Stone grinding</mark> spices and grains by hand remains a traditional practice in many communities.</p>

                <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
                <p>Coffee ceremonies in Ethiopia and Eritrea are sacred rituals of hospitality, with beans roasted, ground, and brewed in a ceremonial process that can take hours. The communal nature of eating from a shared injera platter strengthens family bonds and social connections.</p>
                
                <p>Nyama choma gatherings are social events where meat is grilled slowly over open flames while friends and family share stories and laughter. The coastal Swahili culture blends African and Arab traditions in both food and dining customs, creating unique fusion experiences.</p>
