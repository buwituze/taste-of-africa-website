                <h2>The Rich History of African Cuisine</h2>
                
                <h3>Ancient Roots</h3>
                <p>African cuisine has roots stretching back thousands of years, with evidence of sophisticated agricultural practices in ancient Egypt, Ethiopia, and West Africa. Indigenous grains like teff, sorghum, and millet were cultivated long before wheat and rice became global staples. The continent's diverse ecosystems—from Mediterranean coastlines to tropical rainforests, vast savannas to arid deserts—created distinct regional food cultures adapted to local ingredients and climates.</p>
                
                <h3>Trade Routes and Cultural Exchange</h3>
                <p>African cuisine has been shaped by centuries of trade and cultural exchange. The ancient spice trade connected East Africa to India, Arabia, and beyond, introducing cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon to coastal communities. Trans-Saharan trade routes brought North African flavors south, while Arab merchants influenced cooking techniques and ingredient combinations across the continent.</p>
                
                <p>The Columbian Exchange introduced new ingredients from the Americas—tomatoes, peppers, corn, and cassava—which were adopted and transformed into quintessentially African dishes. Today's beloved recipes represent this rich tapestry of indigenous traditions and global influences.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Influence</h3>
                <p>African cuisine has profoundly influenced global food culture, often without proper recognition. Enslaved Africans brought their culinary knowledge to the Americas, shaping Southern soul food, Caribbean cuisine, and Brazilian cooking. Ingredients like okra, black-eyed peas, watermelon, and sesame became staples far beyond Africa's borders.</p>
                
                <p>Today, African restaurants and chefs are gaining international acclaim, with dishes like jollof rice, injera, and tagine appearing on menus worldwide. The rise of African superfoods—moringa, baobab, fonio—reflects growing appreciation for the continent's nutritional wisdom.</p>
                
                <h3>Preservation and Innovation</h3>
                <p>While honoring traditional methods passed down through generations, African cuisine continues to evolve. Contemporary African chefs are reimagining classic dishes, creating fusion cuisines, and bringing African flavors to fine dining establishments globally. This dynamic balance between preservation and innovation ensures that African food culture remains vibrant and relevant.</p>
